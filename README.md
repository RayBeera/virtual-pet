In this project I'm going to make my own JavaScript pets.
The pets I'm going to make will have the following features:


- A name

- They can get older

- As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit

I can walk my pet to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️

I can feed my pet to decrease it's hunger. 🍕

I can talk to my pet to see if it needs feeding or walking

If my pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀

If my pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢
